Things to implement:


01a) Search for 2 or more keywords.

04) collector that collects communicator peer addresses - 1 for each communicator

05) add Base64 I2p Support

07) address type, this can contain ANY type of address
  - specific address types
    - testing stream communicator addresses
    - direct communicator addresses
    - gnutella addresses

08)  communicator throttling mechanisms
  - bucket algorithms for trusted/recommended/episodic sources of data

09) sha1-cell: can it be always upper case alphabet?  A23984OJGUP76BGOUJHZGUO0GZFG

10) copy out of the sha1 can have the prefix "http://AID" (stands for Arado-ID plus sha1)

11) enter data : enter description, the paragraph makes a new line in the database. maybe the paragraph should be replaced by the BLANK , so that there is no line break?

13) status bar: show recent button deletes the connection info, maybe this should be added?

14) about help message:  Date could be like in the table and a new line (paragraph) after the version number.

15) a top pulldown menu to copy out or mail the whole line of the data entry, not only a cell

16) Save button in connections/devices tab closes the tab, opening over command like settings or status bar click

17) portability, default install in windows for the ip and url sql databse next to the exe, not in users path, solution: over nsis installer set the registry value.
  -- this is a problem, the data should be per-user, not per-system

21) if the search box is empty and the search button is pressed, act like recent button and show latest results.

22) allow to add ONE Rss/Atom feed to be added to get automatically new urls with title = description.


23) Pressing the recent button should sort parallel the Date time top down, so the latest url on top.

24) settings option for enabled or disabled: "show time in display"-table

25) find an ipv4 way of talking end-to-end with peers
a) finding the other IP => TBD over DHT, e.g. bitdht.sf.net (LGPL) or kadc.sf.net (GPL)

   communicator to collect/send IPs  - 3 of these
  - bitdht (or alternative, e.g. gnutella, kadc) that uses shared IP database

26) find an ipv4 way of talking end-to-end with peers
b) and connecting to it => using the UDP Detection or STUN service, e.g. in bitdht for the dht network or in other protocols, e.g. torrent, gnutella.

29) Implement 3 Http Connection sercers for handling 3 network protocols, ipv4, ipv6, Qt Proxy localhost4444 (-> port definition in settings table, not in gui)

30) set width of sha1-column max to contentmaximum length or by default minimum as long as the arado icon above it
url-display.cpp 133:
    //item->horizontalHeader()->setResizeMode(0, QHeaderView::Stretch);
    //item->setSizeHint (80);
    //item->horizontalHeader()->resizeSection(0, 50); // column 0, width 50
   -- fixed width is a really bad idea 

31) Progress Bar steered by a timer if the search button is pressed.
  -- there is no good information to display a progress bar that makes any sense

32) Url Display: Row Width
- Fixed Width for header browse
- Fixed Maximum With for Header Time
- Default Widht for Sha1 Header, extenable as long as content, minimum as logo width

33) Make the Browse icon a Browse Button with icon

34)  Start Sync button or Menue switches to Url Display page and start the progress bar (timed)

36) Settings allow to disable Time Row View on url display

37) Question, if the Network tab should be closable?

38) URL-Cell: Context Menu with command: "Rate Good", which overwrites the timestamp with the actual time,
which causes this Good Rated Url to be on top and spread again. 



DONE:

--) DONE: database of URLs  - 1 of these (DONE)

DONE) communicator to collect/send URLs  - 3 of these
  - testing communicator that reads from stream, writes to stream
  - direct communicator that uses TCP/SSL sockets

  Things to define:

--) DONE: address types
  - this is per communicator

--) DONE: URL data type (DONE)
--) DONE: highlighting the description cell could expand the table line hight, so that the full description can be read? does Qt allow that?

--) DONE: Status bar shows always the connection status "30/30", as well in the recent & search results, or appears back after a few seconds

--) DONE: Hight of cells in the table should be less, so that more lines are in the display shown. Depends on mac compilation. Task for later.

--) UNFUNCTIONAL: this url to add does not work: ed2k://|file|Ununtu-Installer.exe|840874328|A277913309C5804099C64E513D7C56BB|/
   -- this is not a URL, its not supposed to work - syntactically incorrect URLS will not always work, tell the edonkey people to fix their "urls".

--) DONE handle large mounts of data, especially for the Doublette check: => done over hashcache for the last 10.000 entries, then full time for whole database check.
   -- too early to call this "done", we haven't tested with any serious numbers

--) DONE: make the ip stuff to talk to different peers: trusted/constant, remote, eposodic/flexible

--) DONE Import Export IP lists XML connected

--) DONE: Move the Browse button into each line in the last row. With kugar icon.
