Things to implement:

--) DONE: database of URLs  - 1 of these (DONE)

01a) Search for 2 or more keywords.

02) communicator to collect/send URLs  - 3 of these
  - testing communicator that reads from stream, writes to stream
  - direct communicator that uses TCP/SSL sockets
  - gnutella (or alternative) that uses shared database

04) collector that collects communicator peer addresses - 1 for each communicator

Things to define:

05) address types
  - this is per communicator

--) DONE: URL data type (DONE)

07) address type, this can contain ANY type of address
  - specific address types
    - testing stream communicator addresses
    - direct communicator addresses
    - gnutella addresses

08)  communicator throttling mechanisms
  - bucket algorithms for trusted/recommended/episodic sources of data

09) sha1-cell: can it be always upper case alphabet?  A23984OJGUP76BGOUJHZGUO0GZFG

10) copy out of the sha1 can have the prefix "Arado-ID:"

11) enter data : enter description, the paragraph makes a new line in the database. maybe the paragraph should be replaced by the BLANK , so that there is no line break?

--) DONE: highlighting the description cell could expand the table line hight, so that the full description can be read? does Qt allow that?

13) status bar: show recent button deletes the connection info, maybe this should be added?

14) about help message:  Date could be like in the table and a new line (paragraph) after the version number.

15) a top pulldown menu to copy out or mail the whole line of the data entry, not only a cell

16) Save button in connections/devices tab closes the tab, opening over command like settings or status bar click

17) portability, default install in windows for the ip and url sql databse next to the exe, not in users path, solution: over nsis installer set the registry value.

--) DONE: Status bar shows always the connection status "30/30", as well in the recent & search results, or appears back after a few seconds

--) DONE: Hight of cells in the table should be less, so that more lines are in the display shown. Depends on mac compilation. Task for later.

--) UNFUNCTIONAL: this url to add does not work: ed2k://|file|Ununtu-Installer.exe|840874328|A277913309C5804099C64E513D7C56BB|/

21) if the search box is empty and the search button is pressed, act like recent button and show latest results.

22) allow to add ONE Rss/Atom feed to be added to get automatically new urls with title = description.

23) Pressing the recent button should sort parallel the Date time top down, so the latest url on top.
