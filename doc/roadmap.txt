ideas for possible things to implement by occasion:


05) add Base64 I2p Support

08)  communicator throttling mechanisms
  - bucket algorithms for trusted/recommended/episodic sources of data

09) sha1-cell: can it be always upper case alphabet?  A23984OJGUP76BGOUJHZGUO0GZFG

10) copy out of the sha1 can have the prefix "Arado-ID" 

11) enter data : enter description, the paragraph makes a new line in the database. maybe the paragraph should be replaced by the BLANK , so that there is no line break?

13) status bar: show recent button deletes the connection info, maybe this should be added?
   -- what does this mean ? There never was any connection into in the status
      bar. It currently contains the status of what has recently been done.

14) about help message:  Date could be like in the table and a new line (paragraph) after the version number.
    -- NO. 

15) a top pulldown menu to copy out or mail the whole line of the data entry, not only a cell
    -- Yes, this would be a nice thing to have. Maybe in a context menu of
       one of the items on the line, where there already is a mailto function.


22) allow to add ONE Rss/Atom feed to be added to get automatically new urls with title = description.
  -- Why only one? If we add this, it only makes sense to add an arbitrary
     number of RSS feeds. Then we need an additional database, or additional
     tables in the ipbase.sql, to manage all the RSS feeds. This is real work.
  -- Only One RSS Feed per user, as all other feeds come over other users.
	RSS feed needs only one user to add the feed for all connected devices.


23) Pressing the recent button should sort parallel the Date time top down, so the latest url on top.
  -- No, the recent button should not affect how the data are sorted. They 
     may be sorted by something other than date, because the user wants it that
     way.

24) settings option for enabled or disabled: "show time in display"-table
  -- what for? We don't want optional cloumns if we can avoid it. Add complexity
     when it actually adds funcitonality.
  -- Timestamp is already shown in url display, new option in settings would be, to not show timestamp column,
 	if the recent button ic connected to a descending sortening, fresh on top.

25) find an ipv4 way of talking end-to-end with peers
a) finding the other IP => TBD over DHT, e.g. bitdht.sf.net (LGPL) or kadc.sf.net (GPL)

   communicator to collect/send IPs  - 3 of these
  - bitdht (or alternative, e.g. gnutella, kadc) that uses shared IP database

26) find an ipv4 way of talking end-to-end with peers
b) and connecting to it => using the UDP Detection or STUN service, e.g. in bitdht for the dht network or in other protocols, e.g. torrent, gnutella.

29) Implement 3 Http Connection sercers for handling 3 network protocols, ipv4, ipv6, Qt Proxy localhost4444 (-> port definition in settings table, not in gui)

30) set width of sha1-column max to contentmaximum length or by default minimum as long as the arado icon above it
url-display.cpp 133:
    //item->horizontalHeader()->setResizeMode(0, QHeaderView::Stretch);
    //item->setSizeHint (80);
    //item->horizontalHeader()->resizeSection(0, 50); // column 0, width 50
   -- fixed width is a really bad idea 

31) Progress Bar steered by a timer if the search button is pressed.
  -- there is no good information to display a progress bar that makes any sense

32) Url Display: Row Width
- Fixed Width for header browse
- Fixed Maximum With for Header Time
- Default Widht for Sha1 Header, extenable as long as content, minimum as logo width

33) Make the Browse icon a Browse Button with icon

34)  Start Sync button or Menue switches to Url Display page and start the progress bar (timed)

36) Settings allow to disable Time Row View on url display


38) URL-Cell: Context Menu with command: "Rate Good", which overwrites the timestamp with the actual time,
which causes this Good Rated Url to be on top and spread again. 
  -- NO, this won't help spread the URL any more than it already is. The
     timestamp is local, and other nodes will recoginize the hash (sha) and
     won't update the URL.

39) Extended Search: Second Press on Search Button could ask the connected peers for hash or keyword, option to disable in settings, default on

40) No hardcoded url to webmailers for UUID Mailsent

41) OWN Ip and UUID is sent over Sync Button-Press, but not by default, otherwise a lot of users will not connect.

42) Move Database to another hard disk.

43) Get/api: replace "arado" in url-string with UUID. Mabye make "request" = "r" and count = "c" to be shorter?

44) https?

45) Extended Search: Second press on the Search button, with same searchterms, ask a few central searchengines, e.g. yacy Portals,
but extended search should not ask Arado nodes, as this search is done locally as filter only.

46) Thumbnail-image: Search URL Cell for webloadable URL, if not found/loadable, do the same for keywords cell,
    load the url in a hidden Qtwebkit-window process and make a thumbnail
    Start this process and load the Weburl in case, the user clicks on the description cell with then higher Hight, and display the thumbnail png on the left.
    The Arado XML then might need an entryitem >thumbnail< which points to a hash for the image database cache with 1000 impage entries
    or and reply get to the server to generate then (in a webinterface) 10 thumbnails
    http://127.0.0.1/arado?request=recent&count=5   -> might need to be extended then with "&webgui=true", to know get requestes to create 10 thumbnails
    are of interest.

===============================================================================================================
DONE:

--) DONE: database of URLs  - 1 of these (DONE)

DONE) communicator to collect/send URLs  - 3 of these
  - testing communicator that reads from stream, writes to stream
  - direct communicator that uses TCP/SSL sockets

  Things to define:

--) DONE: address types
  - this is per communicator

--) DONE: URL data type (DONE)
--) DONE: highlighting the description cell could expand the table line hight, so that the full description can be read? does Qt allow that?

--) DONE: Status bar shows always the connection status "30/30", as well in the recent & search results, or appears back after a few seconds

--) DONE: Hight of cells in the table should be less, so that more lines are in the display shown. Depends on mac compilation. Task for later.

--) UNFUNCTIONAL: this url to add does not work: ed2k://|file|Ununtu-Installer.exe|840874328|A277913309C5804099C64E513D7C56BB|/
   -- this is not a URL, its not supposed to work - syntactically incorrect URLS will not always work, tell the edonkey people to fix their "urls".
   -- I object to labeling this "UNFUNCTIONAL", is sounds as if it is wrong 
      in Arado. It isn't, it is wrong in eDonkey. (Bernd).

--) DONE handle large mounts of data, especially for the Doublette check: => done over hashcache for the last 10.000 entries, then full time for whole database check.
   -- too early to call this "done", we haven't tested with any serious numbers

--) DONE: make the ip stuff to talk to different peers: trusted/constant, remote, eposodic/flexible

--) DONE Import Export IP lists XML connected

--) DONE: Move the Browse button into each line in the last row. With kugar icon.

--) Question, if the Network tab should be closable?
   -- probably not. It doesn't take up any extra space, and there is no way to
      open it now. Unless we want another drop-down menu.
  -- OK. Done.

--) if the search box is empty and the search button is pressed, act like recent button and show latest results.
  -- NO, if the search box is empty and the search button is pressed, do nothing.
     If the user wants recent, they should click recent.
 -- OK. Done.

--) portability, default install in windows for the ip and url sql databse next to the exe, not in users path, solution: over nsis installer set the registry value.
  -- this is a problem, the data should be per-user, not per-system.
     Windows applications have been doing this wrong for 25 years.

--) Save button in connections/devices tab closes the tab, opening over command like settings or status bar click
    -- THere is no way to open the connections tab right now.

--) DONE: address type, this can contain ANY type of address
  - specific address types
    - testing stream communicator addresses
    - direct communicator addresses
    - gnutella addresses

--) DONE: collector that collects communicator peer addresses - 1 for each communicator

--) DONE: Search for 2 or more keywords.
